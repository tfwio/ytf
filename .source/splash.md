FIRST STEPS
=========

As indispensable as youtube-dl may be, it still needs a bit of help dealing with the variety of AV file-formats it encounters.

i.   Get youtube-dl (from the link below) and extract it somewhere.
ii.  DragDrop youtube-dl.exe into this app to tell it where it is.
iii. Get AVConv and do the same.
iv.  Get FFmpeg and do the same.
v.   Go get AtomicParsley and do the same.

LINKS
=========

youtube-dl uses a small handful of tools to help when it comes to adding meta-data (title, album, cover-art, etc...) to the media it downloads while also many audio formats from the wild can use some fine-tuning every now and again in which case FFmpeg and/or (libAV) will become quite useful.

It may seem daunting when you see the many available builds for libav, though simple enough to just choose the most recent release version.

Alternatively, you can download a nightly version, as above just find the most recent one on the page.

FFmpeg
--------------
